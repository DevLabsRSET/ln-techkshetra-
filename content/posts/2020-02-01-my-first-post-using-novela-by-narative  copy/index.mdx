Sem ends mean running back and forth in our college corridors, begging teachers to make up for
attendance shortage. These sprints are also prevalently seen when it comes to assignment
submission deadlines, because overcoming the infamous 22.5 barrier is indeed a matter of life and
death for the whole lot of us or even running to the honesty shop to grab that last sheet of graph
paper because the final record submission would be due in 10 minutes and need I say about the
gazillion times we walk till our shoes wear off to get an approval or a signature! These corridors also
see us loitering around aimlessly going in rounds around the quadrangle, where the water coolers
placed diagonally are our pitstops to socialise and share a chali or two or maybe even look in the
people passing by, for that one special person! They witness us on our bad days, when we can barely
pull ourselves together to make it to college and on the other hand they also see us on our happy
best days, be it during bharatham screaming the name of our house or even laughing hysterically,
leaning onto those metal rails, reminiscing a joke that happened the previous hour or having a
soulful conversation over a cup of steaming hot machine coffee. 4 years of walking through the
same corridors every single day might sound mundane and utterly monotonous but I believe by the
time we graduate these corridors and the good times it gave us will become a part of our lives,
etched in our memories forever.

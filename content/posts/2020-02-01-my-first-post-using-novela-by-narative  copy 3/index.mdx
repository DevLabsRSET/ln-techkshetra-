Dear diary,
Oh how much I had waited for this day! Finally, the internal examinations are over! My eyes are
surrounded by big dark circles but bigger is the spark in them. I can already hear the sound of
trumpets. Techkshetra is just eight days away!
Today evening, I saw the deco team creating the list of their utilities. The website would be up any
given moment! The list of workshops is ready! Posters look dapper!
Oh wait! I think one workshop is scheduled for this Monday itself! Does this mean the festival of
technology starts three days from now? Oh, that explains all the colourful WhatsApp and Instagram
statuses i was seeing whole day! And those cute forwarded texts too! Oh yes! The ones with
adorable emojis!!
Hey diary, they plan to make a blog out of our everyday conversations! How rude right? I mean
where are the privacy laws? We&#39;ll deal with that later! As of now, I&#39;m excited for 16th November,
2019! I believe it&#39;s gonna be one of the best technical fests ever! Too much hype huh? It&#39;s gonna be
worth the hype!
I believe that! So should you!
